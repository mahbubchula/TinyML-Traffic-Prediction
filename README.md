## 📄 Abstract
The deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is often hindered by high computational costs and data scarcity. This project introduces a **Few-Shot TinyML framework** capable of accurate traffic forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices. [cite_start]Our 1D-CNN model achieves a memory footprint of just **5.46 KB** and adapts to new traffic environments using only **48 hours** of calibration data[cite: 1, 21].

## 🏆 Key Results
- [cite_start]**Model Size:** 5.46 KB (90% reduction vs standard CNN)[cite: 57].
- [cite_start]**Accuracy:** MSE of 564.72 after 48-hour adaptation[cite: 23].
- [cite_start]**Efficiency:** 60x more energy-efficient than cloud-based alternatives[cite: 319].
